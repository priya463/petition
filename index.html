Rape is the 4th common crime committed against women and children.  The brutal gang rape of Nirbhaya in the cold chilly December night of 2012, shook the nation to the core. Millions came out on the streets and demands regarding the amendment of the rape law was voiced out. The tragedy is one Nirbhaya was not enough, thousands came after that – Unnao rape case, Kathua’s Asifa, Kamduni’s Shipra, Hyderabad’s Dr. Priyanka Reddy and thousands unnamed suffer every minute. To the above list, now we have added name of Manisha, the victim of “Hathras rape case.” A proud moment indeed! Despite several protests and mass gatherings, nothing has changed. Still a woman’s body is regarded as a commodity to be violated, her say has no meaning, her NO has no effect. WHY ARE INDIAN WOMEN SUFFERING? The simple answer is our legal procedure, which contains several loopholes. These loopholes are effectively used by the criminals to accuse the victim. Our punishment is not stringent either and one can easily get away with it. We have several laws, some of which has also been changed recently. The nationwide public outcry, in 2012, following the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder in Delhi, led to the passing of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2013 which widened the definition of rape and made punishment more stringent.2 Parliament made the amendments on the recommendation of the Justice J.S. Verma Committee, which was constituted to re-look the criminal laws in the country and recommend changes.3 The 2013 Act, which came into effect on April 2, 2013, increased jail terms in most sexual assault cases and also provided for the death penalty in rape cases that cause death of the victim or leaves her in a vegetative state. It also created new offences, such as use of criminal force on a woman with intent to disrobe, voyeurism and stalking.4 Earlier, there was no specific provision in law for offences such as use of unwelcome physical contact, words or gestures, demand, or request for sexual favours, showing pornography against the will of a woman or making sexual remarks. But the 2013 Act clearly defined these offences and allocated punishment. Similarly, stalking was made punishable with up to three years in jail. The offence of acid attack was increased to 10 years of imprisonment.The punishment for gang rape was increased to 20 years to life imprisonment from the earlier 10 years to life imprisonment. What about offences against minors? In January 2018, an eight-year-old girl in Rasana village near Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir was abducted, raped, and murdered by a group of men. The news of the shocking act led to nationwide protests and calls for harsher punishment.This led to the passing of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 which for the first time put death penalty as a possible punishment for rape of a girl under 12 years; the minimum punishment is 20 years in jail. Then the question arises, that what happens to the paedophiles, whose victims are children below the age of 12? Are they then free to move about and create further traumas through their misdeeds of sexual exploitation? Another new section was also inserted in the IPC to specifically deal with rape on a girl below 16 years. The provision made the offence punishable with minimum imprisonment of 20 years which may extend to imprisonment for life. The minimum jail term for rape, which has remained unchanged since the introduction of the IPC in 1860, was increased from seven to 10 years.However, the reality of the implementation of these laws is quite different. In India, every rape is being politicised. It takes 10-12 years to pass death sentence or life imprisonment to the rapists. This also takes the form of quarrel among political parties each one trying to grab public attention, but no actual implementation of law takes place. Moreover, the punishments for the juvenile rapists is penitentiary. The point of contestation is if they can partake willingly and consciously, in a heinous crime like rape, why will not they be treated like adults and given punishments accordingly. CONCLUSION… WOMEN CONDITION REMAINS AS IT WAS. OUR WOMEN CONTINUE TO BE RAPED AND KILLED. A study by the Centre of Death Penalty - at the National Law University Delhi (NLUD) -- in 2015 analysed data of 15 years to conclude that less than 5 per cent death penalties awarded by trial courts were confirmed by the time the cases passed the tests in high courts and the Supreme Court. In around 30 per cent cases, the high courts ordered acquittal of these convicts. Another NLU Delhi study found that 162 death sentences were awarded across the country in 2018. Only 23 were confirmed by the high courts.As citizens of this nation, WE CONDEMN THESE ACTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE and DEMAND STRONG AND STRINGENT PUNISHMENTS FOR THE CRIMINALS WITHIN 1 YEAR OF THE CRIME. STRONG AND STRINGENT ACTIONS CAN ONLY CURBE THE HENIOUS ACTS OF RAPE AND SEXUAL ABUSE, THEREBY PROVIDE SECURITY TO THE INDIAN WOMEN TO MOVE ABOUT FREELY AND FEARLESSLY." target="_blank">Assam Floods<br><br>Repository of Assistance you can provide in the form of Scientifically researched Email Petition, Kind and Fundraisers</a></h1> </div>
