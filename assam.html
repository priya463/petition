Ltd., experienced a blowout on 27th May 2020 which was followed by a massive fire explosion on 9th June 2020 - all the while oil from the well continued to leak. </p><p>This disaster has opened our eyes to a history of exploitative and illegal practices adopted by OIL India Ltd. with the irrevocable support of MoEFCC.</p><p>There has undeniably been a <strong>huge loss of biodiversity, livelihoods, and oil reserves. </strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Biodiversity: </strong>Report (as per status of leak from 28th May 2020 to 2nd June 2020) by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) states that <em> “The toxins released are known to have long-term persistence in soils and sediments, which will not only affect current life conditions, but due to sustained release over a long period, pose a serious health risk for a longer term “ </em></strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Livelihoods:</strong> While 50 houses have been burnt, several households are flooded with water mixed with oil condensate. Farms have been rendered useless for years to come and current cropland and livestock has been damaged. </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Oil reserves: </strong>As per company report, cumulative production loss since May 27 due to bandhs and blockades has been <strong>5386 MT of crude oil </strong>and <strong>7.04 MMSCM of natural gas.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>The foremost question to be asked is: Could this disaster be prevented, and if a disaster is an unfortunate possibility then, could the impact of this disaster have been reduced?</strong></p><p>A disaster of this scale is attributed to not merely negligence of oil well operators on one day but to a history of negligence displayed by OIL India Ltd., MoEFCC and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. Unless authorities from the aforementioned organisations accept their complicity to the disaster, more such disasters will happen in the future.</p><p>In an attempt to answer the question - whether the impact of the disaster could be reduced - we bring the following points to light: </p><ul><li><strong><strong>Oil and Natural gas exploration is an extremely complex practice. </strong></strong></li></ul><p>Several studies show that mishandling of such a plant could lead to the devastation of not only the local environment but also affect the global environmental conditions.</p><p>Given the risky nature of exploration and mining projects, the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) is expected to have a strict approach towards them, while the companies handling such projects are expected to have a sensitive approach towards the local communities and biodiversity.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>India currently faces a huge lack of expertise to deal with oil spills and related incidents.</strong></strong></li></ul><p>It is observed that India’s efforts to explore oil, mine coal etc. are placed in the best interest of the economy but such projects are not equipped with adequate facilities to deal with on-site accidents - as has been observed from previous oil spills in the country (major ones including Chennai(2016) and Sunderbans(2014)). The response work after the Baghjan incident appeared to be as inefficient as response work after the previous incidents. The disasters in the past decade had brought the need for a proper dissemination and management system to light, but compliance with these vital rules remains extremely low.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Baghjan incident is not Assam’s first encounter with an oil leak</strong></strong></li></ul><p>In 2012, oil leakage was reported from different localities in the Deohal area near the oil township Duliajan, Assam (India). The source was located in a gas reservoir in the Palaeogene sediments (Barail group) (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308969738_Gas_leakage_from_palaeogene_reservoir_in_Assam_-_a_geophysical_puzzle). Several local organisations had claimed that it was due to the illegal construction of the second pipeline which wreaked havoc in the Maguri-Beel wetland.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>History of ignoring concerns of local people</strong></strong></li></ul><p>A recent report from The Wire clearly states - “This ToR (Terms of Reference) required OIL to conduct a public hearing on the proposed site of the project. However, OIL requested the EAC (Expert Appraisal Committee) to exempt it from conducting a public hearing. The EAC obliged and the ToR was amended in February 2017 (http://environmentclearance.nic.in/writereaddata/Form-1A/Minutes/22032017KWOKFD7K20thEACMinutesofMeeting27-28February.pdf) to take out the requirement of public hearing. “</p><p>In addition to this, authorities have also failed to pay heed to the local public when they have protested against expansion of the excavation project in the past few years. Even in 2019, activists had demanded OIL India Ltd. to pause the work that they had initiated much before attaining a clearance letter from National Board of Wildlife (NBWL).</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Environmental clearance given to OIL India Ltd. dated 11th May 2020</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The environmental clearance accorded for Extension Drilling and Testing Hydrocarbons at seven locations under Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, Northwest of Baghjan PMLto OIL India Ltd. This decision came despite the close proximity of the oil well near Protected Areas which was vigorously protested against by local villagers.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Implications of clearances given through Zoom by MoEFCC, during COVID-19</strong></strong></li></ul><p>As per the <strong>Draft EIA Notification, 2020,</strong> “projects that have violated environment clearance norms will be given<strong> a chance for post-facto approvals</strong> as long as that project is permissible in the area. “ (https://india.mongabay.com/2020/04/government-pushes-for-post-facto-environment-clearances-while-apex-court-disapproves)</p><p><strong>The questions being posed against this notification by environmentalists should, at least now, seem well-founded, since the OIL project in Dibru-Saikhowa had also been seeking post-facto approval. </strong></p><p>Analysis of these details brings us to the conclusion that it is because of the gross violation of rules throughout the years of operation that have led to the exacerbation of the disaster that occurred on 27th May 2020. Even though previous such disasters have not led to a systemic change in which oil exploration projects are handled, the recent incident should not suffer the same fate as well. The scale of livelihood and biodiversity loss in the Dibru-Saikhowa region is frightening and it would be a humanitarian disaster if we let such disasters occur again, just to avoid accountability. </p><p>While we acknowledge the steps being taken for evacuation, restoration and compensation, it must be noted that all of this could be prevented had the company invested in precaution and conservation much before the incident. The non-negotiable demands from OIL India Ltd., MoEFCC, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>The evacuated villagers must immediately be shifted to shelter facilities with more space and better medical facilities. </strong></strong></li></ul><p><em>As per on-ground reports, the villagers have complained of inadequate facilities in shelter camp, hence providing them with better facilities should be a top priority.</em></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Strict action against OIL India Ltd. and withdrawal of Environmental Clearance (EC) given for Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) in Dibru-Saikhowa National Park</strong></strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Immediate steps to be taken to restore the habitats in and around Dibru Saikhowa National Park and Maguri Motapung Beel, as prescribed by WWF-India</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Immediate stop on all oil mining, drilling and exploration projects in the Dibru Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve in order to prevent any future damages to the inhabitants and the biodiversity of the area</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Explanation from OIL India Ltd. for not being equipped with appropriate facilities and expertise to prevent and mitigate such disasters</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Compensation accompanied by long-term rehabilitation of all affected villagers</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Withdrawal of the draft EIA notification 2020 and strict action against projects seeking post-facto approvals</strong></li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Regards,</p><p>An earthling and concerned citizen</p>';">
